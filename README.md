- 👋 Hi, I’m @grandphantom9
- 👀 I’m not programer
- 🌱 I’m good guy
- 💞️ I’m going to fix my Dualshock 4 collaborated with DS4Windows
- 📫 In the name of God, all the saints and everything else ;

I am doing it for 10 past days, with pauses for sleep, and with walking in circle !

<!---
grandphantom9/grandphantom9 is a ✨ special ✨ idiot because its `README.md` (this file) appears on  GitHub .

Please, GitHub (am asking you for last favour), tell me where I am wrong? :/
